"""
The bitmap module provides the ability to paint bitmap images and save them as either PNG images or frames.

The module is based on the popular [PIL Python imaging library](/python-libraries/pillow/). This provides many
functions for manipulating bitmap images, such as colour manipulation, filters, enhancement, morphing, colour channel
operations, and pixel access. It also provides drawing operations (rectangles, ellipses, text etc), but these are not as
powerful as the vector methods available via Pycairo in the `generativepy.drawing` module.

generativepy actually uses the Pillow library, which is a fork of PIL. That is because Pillow is actively maintained
whereas PIL is not. The Pillow library is compatible, and is still imported using the name PIL. We will refer to is as
PIL in the documentation.

class Scaler:
    """
    A PIL Image object always works in pixels. Unlike a Pycairo context used by `make_image` and similar functions, Image
    has no concept of a user space.

    However, it is sometimes useful to be able to calculate values in a user space and convert them to image pixels (device
    space), or vice versa.

    The `Scaler` class provides this functionality. You can create a scaler object with the dimensions of the image and the
    required user space. The scaler object can then be used to convert coordinates from one space to another.
