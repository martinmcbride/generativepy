# Unit tests

This area contains unit tests for generativepy.

These tests use the standard Python unittest module.

Run all_unit_tests.py to run all the tests.

Many areas of the code cannot easily be unit tested because they create image output that needs to be checked. There are separate tests for this in the imagetests area.
